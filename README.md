✅ Topics Covered So Far

🔹 Data Types
Learned about primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint) and non-primitive types (objects, arrays, functions). Understood how JavaScript handles type conversion and dynamic typing.

🔹 Control Flow
Explored if-else statements, switch cases, and loops. Practiced making decisions in code and controlling how programs execute based on conditions.

🔹 Functions & Arrow Functions
Learned how to write reusable blocks of code with functions, the difference between function declarations & expressions, and how arrow functions simplify syntax while handling this differently.

🔹 Scope
Understood the difference between global, local, and block scope. Learned how variables declared with var, let, and const behave in different contexts.

🔹 Arrays
Explored array creation, indexing, and built-in methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice. Also practiced looping through arrays using for, for...of, and forEach.

🔹 Objects
Learned about object creation, properties, and methods. Understood how to access/update values using dot and bracket notation, and how objects store key-value pairs.

🔹 Filter & Map
Practiced using higher-order array methods:
filter() → selecting elements based on conditions
map() → transforming elements and returning a new array

🔹 Truthy & Falsy Values
Learned which values JavaScript considers true or false in conditional statements. For example:
Falsy → 0, "", null, undefined, NaN, false
Everything else → Truthy

🔹 Iterations
Practiced different looping methods:
for and while → traditional loops
for...of → iterate over values
for...in → iterate over object keys


🔮 Next Steps

Promises & Async/Await
DOM Manipulation
Event Handling
ES6+ Features (destructuring, classes, modules)
Mini Projects (To-Do App, Quiz App, Weather App)
